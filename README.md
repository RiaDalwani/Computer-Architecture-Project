# Computer Architecture Project

This project demonstrates a simple CPU architecture using digital logic simulation tools like **Logisim**. It includes a circuit design and a hexadecimal instruction file to simulate instruction execution.

## 📁 Features

- CPU architecture implemented using logic gates and components
- Loads instruction memory from a `.hex` file
- Designed for educational use in computer architecture courses

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Logisim** (or compatible logic simulator)
- **Hex editor** (for writing instruction sets)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `CA Project.circ` in **Logisim** or any compatible simulator.
2. Load `instructions.hex` into the instruction memory module (as required).
3. Simulate the CPU by providing clock signals and viewing outputs.
